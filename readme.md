# Ys Vi: The Ark of Napishtim Decompilation
- Release: Steam NA 1.2.0.1 (Not DX9)
- Publisher: XSEED Games (2015, Windows 10)
- Original: Nihon Falcom Corp. (2003, Windows 7/8/Vista/Xp)

## The Project
Decompile Ys Vi's modern english release using Ghidra for the purpose of quality of life changes and understanding the game. As far as I am aware, I am one of the first to research modifications for this game, so there is a lot to discover. I am learning as I go, and I am making pretty steady progress in my free time.

## The Goals
- Obtain a solid understanding of the game's fundamental systems
- Replace the default HD english font (MS Gothic) with something more fitting
- Enable modifications to character portraits and music tracks
- Enable modifications to game balance

## Hopes and Dreams
- Implement the japanese dub from the PS2 release (The English dub uses Konami's translation and thus would not fit)
- Complete decompilation
