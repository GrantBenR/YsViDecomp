## The Project
Decompile Ys Vi's modern english release using Ghidra for the purpose of quality of life changes and understanding the game

## The Goals
- Obtain a solid understanding of the game's fundamental systems
- Replace the default HD english font (MS Gothic) with something more fitting
- Enable modifications to character portraits and music tracks
- Enable modifications to game balance

## Hopes and Dreams
- Implement the japanese dub from the PS2 release (The English dub uses Konami's translation and thus would not fit)
- Complete decompilation
